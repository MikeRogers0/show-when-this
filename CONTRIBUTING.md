# Contributing

## Fork, fix then PR

If you find something you want to change, fork the repo then send a pull request. If CI passes & everything looks good I'll merge it in. If possible keep each PR to a single commit and fixing a single problem. 

I generally check GitHub daily, but don't be upset if I take a few days to merge the PR.

## Open an issue

If you just want to flag something up, just open an issue on the repo.

## Running the tests

Before you send a PR make sure all the tests are passing, you can do this by in the browser by opening the `test/*.html` files in your browser & verfiying there are no big red failing tests.
